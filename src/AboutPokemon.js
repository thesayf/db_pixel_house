            For more than 15 years, kids all over the world have been discovering 
            the enchanting world of Pokémon. Today, the Pokémon family of products 
            includes video games, the Pokémon Trading Card Game, the Pokémon animated 
            TV series, movies, toys, and much more. The games encourage strategic thinking 
            and, in many cases, basic math skills. Pokémon puts a strong emphasis on good 
            sportsmanship and respect for other players, as well. And many parents feel 
            that the Pokémon TCG and Pokémon video games encourage their children to learn to 
            read, since reading is required in most Pokémon games.

            Pokémon are creatures of all shapes and sizes who live in the wild or alongside 
            humans. For the most part, Pokémon do not speak except to utter their names. 
            Pokémon are raised and commanded by their owners (called “Trainers”). During 
            their adventures, Pokémon grow and become more experienced and even, on occasion, 
            evolve into stronger Pokémon. There are currently more than 700 creatures that 
            inhabit the Pokémon universe.
